# SingleCellHumanEmbryo

Scripts for analyzing and reproducing the figures of the manuscripts "The Single-cell and spatial transcriptional landscape of human gastrulation, early organogenesis and brain development".

The following analysis scripts are included:

* 1 ScRNA-seq analysis of all human samples
* 2 ScRNA-seq analysis of the PCW3 samples
* 3.1 Read and merge the human gastrula data with the PCW3 data
* 3.2 Seurat integration analysis of human gastrula and PCW3 data
* 3.3 Human gastrulational development analysis
* 4 scRNA-seq analysis of human whole embyros of PCW3-5
* 5 Spatial transcriptomic analysis of human PCW5 embryo
* 6 human early whole embryo organogenesis analysis
